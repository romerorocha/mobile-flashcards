## Flashcards for iOS
This is project #3 of the Udacity React Nanodegree. It's an React Native app, built and tested for **iOS only**.

## Install & Run
To install the app:
`yarn install`

To run it:
`yarn start` and than `i` to run on Simulator or `q` to display the QR code for iPhone.

You'll need Expo installed in your iPhone or a Mac (Xcode must be installed) to be able to run it. 

## Features
The app's main purpose is to help you to study using decks of cards.

Once you've added a new deck (and cards to it), you can perform a Quiz to test your knowledge.

The app also notifies you to take the Quiz, if you haven't done yet at the present day (at 2 p.m.).
